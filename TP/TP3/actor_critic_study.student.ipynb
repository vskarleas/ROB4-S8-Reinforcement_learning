    "\n",
    "We consider a value-based critic $V(s)$. The extension to an action value function $Q(s,a)$ is straightforward.\n",

    "To update the critic, the algorithm computes the temporal difference error:\n",

    "$$\\delta_t = r(s_t, a_t) + \\gamma V^{(n)}(s_{t+1})-V^{(n)}(s_t).$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$V^{(n+1)}(s_t) = V^{(n)}(s_t) + \\alpha_{critic} \\delta_t.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To update the actor, the general idea is the same, using the temporal difference error with another learning rate $\\alpha_{actor}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, naively applying the same learning rule would not ensure that the probabilities of all actions in a state sum to 1.\n",
    "Besides, when the temporal difference error $\\delta_t$ is negative, it may happen that the probability of an action gets negative or null, which raises an issue when applying renormalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, instead of applying the naive rule, we apply the following one:\n",
    "$$ \n",

    "\\pi^{(i)}(a_t|s_t) + \\alpha_{actor} \\delta_t & \\mathrm{if } \\pi^{(i)}(a_t|s_t) + \\alpha_{actor} \\delta_t > 10^{-8}\\\\\n",
    "10^{-8} & \\mathrm{otherwise.} \\\\\n",
